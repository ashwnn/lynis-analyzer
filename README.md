## Installation

### Local development
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ashwnn/lynis-analyzer.git
cd lynis-analyzer
npm install
npm run dev
```
The development server runs at <http://localhost:3000>.

### Production build
```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

## Usage
1. Open the hosted app at <https://ashwnn.github.io/lynis-analyzer/> or run it locally.
2. Upload a Lynis `.dat` file.
3. Review the extracted warnings and suggestions.
4. Click **Download JSON** to export the parsed output.
5. (Optional) Open the settings (gear icon), paste your Gemini API key, and click **Analyze with AI** to generate a remediation plan.

## Configuration
- Gemini API key: Open Settings (gear icon) and paste your key. It is stored in `localStorage` under `lynis_gemini_key` and used only in the browser.
- For production, consider a server‑side proxy to keep the API key secret.
- If you encounter CORS errors, you may need to add a small server route that forwards requests to Gemini or adjust CORS settings.
